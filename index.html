        <b>Thinking Like a Programmer</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Programmers and coders use procedural thinking - taking a big problem and breaking down the solution into a set of steps - in order to write valid and useful code. Some examples of procedural thinking are the following:
        </p>
        <ul> 
          <li>Abstract thinking - 1+1=2
          <li>Systematic debugging - systemic way of solving problems
          <li>Technological empathy - thinking the way a computer does, which involves looking at code and imagining what it looks like in a webpage, and looking at a webpage and seeing code
          <li>Systems thinking - taking one big idea and breaking it down into component parts (other 3 mentioned, above)
        </ul>

        <b>Computers Are Stupid</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Programmers need to write the way a computer understands. You need to know the correct “syntax.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Why? Because the computer can’t read your mind, it can only interpret what it sees in the code. If you forget to end a tag with a closing element, for example, forget to end an “em” tag, then it will assume that you want the rest of the narrative to be italicized.

        <b>Programmers Shouldn’t Remember Everything</b>

        <p>
          This idea just highlights the fact that programmers, in this day of readily available information on the internet, shouldn’t feel that they need to memorize everything like in the past. You can just look it up. It’s more important to understand basic concepts.

        <b>The Web and its Major Components</b> 
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Invented 1990’s - now has 30 billion webpages, it's basically a collection of HTML documents (HTML = Hypertext Markup Language). HTML language is what glues everything together on the web - text, videos, images. The links between webpages is what makes the web “weblike.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The web is basically made up of three components: You, your computer and your browser; the internet, and servers. The browser makes requests via the internet to servers with a protocol called HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The server responds with files that your browser displays - browsers include IE, Chrome, Firefox. Servers are computers that are optimized for hosting files instead of browsing.

        <b>HTML: Markup, Tags, Elements, Attributes and Structure</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML docs are the heart of the web and are made up of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text content - what you see
          <li>Mark up - what it looks like or how it is arranged (not seen)
          <li>References to other docs (images, videos)
          <li>Links to other pages
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>HTML markup:</b> HTML markup is made up of tags, which are constructed like this: &lt;opening tag&gt;content&lt;/closing tag&gt;. Examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;b&gt; tag - makes content bold
          <li>&lt;em&gt; tag - means emphasis - makes content italicized
          <li>&lt;a&gt; tag - anchor tag - this is for making links
        </ul>
          <b>HTML attribute tags:</b> An HTML attribute is a modifier of an HTML element. They are usually added to a HTML start tag, which along with content and end tag comprises most HTML elements. Particular attributes are only supported by particular element types; if they are added to elements that do not support them they will not function (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute">HTML attribute</a> Wiki page).  Examples:
        <ul>
          <li>&lt;a href = “www.reddit.com”&gt;derp &lt;/a&gt; = derp
          <li>&lt;a href = “www.w3c.com”&gt; HTML &lt;/a&gt; = HTML
          <li>&lt;a href = “www.udacity.com”&gt;my favorite &lt;/a&gt; = my favorite
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Image tag:</b> &lt;img&gt; is used to download images. For example: &lt;img src = “url” alt = “text”&gt;. “Url” is for the image to download. “Text” is for broken requests - the text that is displayed if image does not load. The image tag does not have or need a closing tag - it’s a “void tag” - it has no content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Whitespace:</b> When you enter text in multiple lines, in HTML it renders it in single space. &lt;br&gt; is to create a space break. This is another example of a void tag. To make double spaces you can use either a &lt;br&gt; or a &lt;p&gt; tag. To use &lt;br&gt; as a double space, you just use two in a row: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;p&gt; is a “block text” - you need a closing tag: &lt;p&gt; narrative &lt;/p&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Inline and block elements:</b> "br" is an “inline element” - just ends a line. "p" narrative is a “block element” - it makes an invisible box to put narrative. The box has width and height.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Span and Div Elements:</b> The "Span" and "Div" tags contain their content: Span is inline and is written like this: &lt;span&gt; text &lt;/span&gt;. Div is block and is written like this: &lt;div&gt; text &lt;/span&gt;. Unlike **div**, which is formatted with line breaks, the **span** element does not have any automatic formatting. In addition to being a block element, **div** also allows you to put footnotes on the page with a **div** element to indicate that everything inside of that div is "footnote material". And you could also style a **div** element by adding a specific class or ID to it.
        </p>

          <b>Structure of HTML Document</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
          &lt;html lang=en&gt;<br>
          &lt;head&gt;<br>

          &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;<br>
          &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css?v=1.0"&gt;
          &lt;/head&gt;<br>
          &lt;body&gt;<br>
          &lt;b&gt;content&lt;/b&gt;<br>
          &lt;/body&gt;<br>
